## 🚀 Overview

**DevPulse** automatically tracks your coding activity and transforms it into meaningful productivity insights — going far beyond simple time tracking.

Instead of just telling you *"you coded 5 hours"*, DevPulse tells you:
> *"3h building features, 1.5h debugging, 30m reading code — and you work best between 10–12 AM."*

## ✨ Features
